The problem
===========

Making presentations is *boring*!
---------------------------------


:data-x: 1600
:data-y: 0

GUI tools are inflexible
========================

* It's hard to reorganize or import text
* Slow and memory hungry
* You get caught up in design early in the process

.. Here you have a view of the current slide, a preview of the next slide
   and your notes.


Use reStructuredText!
=====================

* You can use your favorite text-editor!
* Many tools available: Landslide, S5
* Convenient (and powerful!)

.. You also have a clock and a timer, so you know how much time you have left.


But then there was Prezi
========================

Sliding from left to right is no longer enough.
You need to be able to...

.. If you click on the timer it restarts from zero. This is handy when you
   are rehearsing the presentation and need to make sure it fits in the time
   allocated.


pan...
=========

.. If you have more notes than fit in the console, you can scroll down, but
   more handily, you can scroll the text up by pressing space bar.


rotate...
=========

.. If there isn't more text to scroll up, space bar will go to the next
   slide. Therefore you, as a presenter, just press space every time you run
   out of things to say!

:data-y: 2500
:data-scale: 0.1
:data-rotate-z: 90

and zoom!
=========

.. Zooming is cool. But one day it will grow old as well. What will we do
   then to make presentations interesting?


:data-x: 4000
:data-y: 2500
:data-rotate-z: 90
:data-scale: 1

But Prezi is a GUI
==================

So we are back to square one.
(And it is closed source to boot)

.. It's probably back to making bad jokes again.

:data-y: 2500
:data-scale: 1
:data-rotate-z: 90

What about impress.js?
======================

It's open source!

Supports pan, tilt and zoom!


:data-y: 3700
:data-rotate-x: 180
:data-x: 3200
:data-scale: 1
:data-rotate-z: 90

In three dimensions!
====================

*But...*

.. Wow! 3D! You didn't see that one coming, did you?


:data-x:3200
:data-y:4900
:data-scale:1
:data-rotate-z:90
:data-rotate-x:180

It's HTML...
============

Not a friendly format to edit


:data-x: 4000
:data-y: 4900
:data-scale: 1
:data-rotate-z: 90
:data-rotate-x :180


\...and manual positioning
==========================

So inserting a slide means

repositioning all the following slides!

.. The endless repositioning of slides is what prompted me to write
   Hovercraft! in the first place.


:data-x: 4000
:data-y: 3700
:data-scale: 1
:data-rotate-z: 90
:data-rotate-x: 180

*Is there no solution?*
=======================

Of course there is!

.. What would be the point of this slide show if I didn't have a solution? Duh!

Introducing **rst2html5slides**!

:data-scale:1
:data-y:3700
:data-rotate-z:90
:data-rotate-x:180
:data-rotate-y:180

reStructuredText

*plus*
impress.js *plus* impressConsole.js *plus* positioning!

:data-x:-1500
:data-scale:1
:data-rotate-z:90
:data-rotate-x:180
:data-rotate-y:180

Position slides
===============

* Automatically!
* Absolutely!
* Relative to the previous slide!
* Along an SVG path!

.. That SVG path support was a lot of work. And all I used it for was to
   position the slides in circles.

==================

* A view of the current slide
* A view of the next slide
* Your notes
* A clock
* A timer

.. You found the presenter console already!
